      <description>For as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been intentional about personal finances, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this 2014 blog post to think about the global market portfolio. Time for a refresh.
Turns out there are way more resources available on this than the last time I checked in. (1, 2, 3.) The breakdown looks roughly like:
~45% global equities ~45% global bonds ~21% government bonds ~9% corporate bonds ~5% securitized debt ~10% emerging market debt/other ~4% real estate ~3% commodities (apparently 88% gold!</description>

      <description>Some things I think I know about finance:
I used to be in an EMHy crowd (economists), now find myself in an unusually anti-EMH crowd (AI/Bay Area). It does feel pretty striking to have had a view that implied I could beat the S&amp;amp;P, bet on that view, and in fact (slightly) out-perform the S&amp;amp;P. On the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue with deeply liquid markets filled with smart, highly-incentivized people.</description>

      <description>My mid-2024 hair transplant has only recently started obviously coming into effect. (The growth process is advertised as not starting for 3 months; in my case nothing stark was beginning to happen until month 6ish.) I feel extremely happy with it.
Funnily enough, when I stare into my happiness, it feels really, really not others-facing. It&amp;rsquo;s much more like:
I had a mental image of myself looking a certain way. (Speaking loosely.</description>

      <title>Pick a date</title>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/pick-a-date/</guid>
      <description>Here are some date ideas I&amp;rsquo;m excited about:
Karaoke/Martuni&amp;rsquo;s. Jamming/singalong&amp;hellip; on the beach? Tasting! Coffee/chocolate/tea/wine/etc., ideally cocktails but a bit rough in SF. Sit on a meditation pillow, listen to + comment on music that&amp;rsquo;s personally meaningful. Trampolining/trapeze class/novel exercise thing. Picnic following a short hike. Rooftop spa, sauna (maybe not first date?). Quirky lecture/workshop. Maybe my top choice: an evening loosely themed around your favourite book. If you&amp;rsquo;d be excited to join me for one of these (or have a better suggestion), email joelhbkr@gmail.</description>

      <title>Beginner weightlifting routine from first principles</title>
      <link>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/beginner-workout-routine/</link>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/beginner-workout-routine/</guid>
      <description>The things that really matter in making progress on any weightlifting goal are:
Attending the gym. Pushing yourself to near-max effort, without risking injury. The best way to attend the gym is to be in the habit of intending the gym. So, whilst common advice holds that beginners should start with 2 or so full-body workouts per week, I instead recommend diving in with 4 or so (correspondingly lighter) workouts per week.</description>

      <description>Use only root notes, 1 octave apart, in the left hand. More feels too busy. Transition between chords using reasonable notes (again separated by an octave) in the left hand. Any note in the triad of the chord being transitioned to. Any note that is (a) inside the shortest distance between the root note being transitioned from and root note being transitioned to and (b) in the key of the song.</description>

      <title>Practical advice for valuing time</title>

      <description>TL;DR: forget about current wages, think about what you value, and experiment.
Think about your preferred consumption path How will your wages in 1, 3, 10, or 30 years compare to your wages today? How much will you need in retirement? How important is it to you to have roughly the same spending at different stages of your life? What quantity of rainy-day savings might make you feel comfortable?
(I can&amp;rsquo;t answer these questions for you, although this financial life calculator I made might help.</description>

      <description>An example of how one might arrange one of my mashups.
Some notes on this one:
The arrangement is very simple and rigid. Ideally you want to get some confident singers singing lyrics to different songs over one another, flowing in and out of songs as feels right. But the simpler way to do this &amp;ndash; wordless melody, as here &amp;ndash; works nicely, especially with a less familiar crowd. The worldess melody here is from Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;My Shot.</description>

      <title>Pointing to my aesthetic tastes</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good articulation of my current aesthetic tastes. (Because I am insufficiently articulate and/or they are incoherent.) But here are some pointers.
(I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to make this close-ish-to-orthogonal to my enjoyment of or respect for these things, with only partial success. A bunch of the pointers below share the vibe of &amp;ldquo;maximization good, moderation bad&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; I especially want to emphasize this as a case where my aesthetics come apart from what I think is good on reflection.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve led many a singalong. Some better, some worse. The good ones typically have a couple of things in common:
Multiple guitars. 3+ really enthusiastic singers. Enough participants. 5+ necessary, 10+ starting to get ideal, 100+ is unnecessary but magical. 50%+ of the group know all words in the choruses of 50%+ of songs played. Songs that few people know are quit very quickly. Participants are made to feel included (ideally central, but at least in-on-the-fun).</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a sense in which people who binge netflix are honestly expressing their preferences. They could go for a run, or meditate, or call a friend. If instead they choose netflix, perhaps we should think they prefer netflix by revealed preference.
[DIAGRAM OF NETFLIX VS NOT NETFLIX, WITH CONSTRAINTS]
Yet it&amp;rsquo;s hard to suppress the nagging sense that something is going wrong here. Perhaps the netflix-binger themself feels that their bingeing behavior is getting in the way of what they want to want.</description>

      <description>Maybe there are many axes of internal experience with significant variation; aphantasia/vividness of visual imagery is merely easiest to name.
Some candidates:
Vividness of imagination for senses other than sight &amp;ndash; smell, taste, touch. Stability/control of imagination. Seeing connections/structure vs. more descriptive picture &amp;ndash; paranoia/apophenia, literal-mindedness. Strength of associations &amp;ndash; bouba/kiki, synesthesia. Internal monologue vs&amp;hellip; mentalese? Intensity of sensory experience. </description>

      <description>This is a frame that I casually share with friends, not medical advice. I&amp;rsquo;m not a doctor of any kind.
The frame shades negative because that&amp;rsquo;s what I think is more useful for friends to hear.
The frame ADHD meds give you another option for how to work, with some significant upsides and some significant downsides. It&amp;rsquo;s annoying but possible to transition between periods of using to not using, and it&amp;rsquo;s annoying but possible in a different way to be half-way between using and not using within same period.</description>

      <title>1 set per exercise</title>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/1-set-per-exercise/</guid>
      <description>I prefer for my weightlifting workouts to involve just 1 set per exercise.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly conventional wisdom on this question, but it&amp;rsquo;s extremely common to stick with 3 or so sets per exercise. Defenders of the status quo, when pressed, say something like &amp;ldquo;3 sets helps you measure progression,&amp;rdquo; which is obviously nonsense (you could still maintain a consistent ordered list of exercises with 1 set per exercise).
What are the trade-offs?</description>

      <description>Are there distributed training schemes that don&amp;rsquo;t require syncing weights at end of each training step? (My understanding is that even &amp;lsquo;async&amp;rsquo; approaches require this.) Feels like you could apply old grad updates like momentum - but discounted in ~time rather than training steps. Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t initializing with existing model weights work in NLP?. Or, if it does, why isn&amp;rsquo;t it more common? What is the best practice for training smaller models in a language model family?</description>

For background, I love incongruent mash-ups. These can be hard to find except through trial-and-error&amp;hellip; until LLMs.

      <description>I have my idiosyncrasies. I have aphantasia. I wonder how many of my idiosyncrasies are downstream of aphantasia, given that the condition is not well understood.
Some candidates:
Weak recollection of auto-biographical details. (EDIT: see section 3.4 here suggesting something similar.) Thinking much more clearly whilst walking than staying still. Difficulty understanding the plots of films and TV shows. I once watched Glengarry Glen Ross with a group of friends, got to the end of the film, and thought it would be funny to ask whether anyone understood the story, because I found the film impossible to follow.</description>

      <description>I have aphantasia.
People usually respond to this fact with &amp;ldquo;how do you X&amp;rdquo; questions, which I feel helpless to answer, because there isn&amp;rsquo;t a well-developed language for these things.
How do I navigate in familiar spaces? I&amp;hellip; erm&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; it&amp;hellip;? I can just sort of sense the spatial distance between things, without these things having visual representations. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like if you were awake, closed your eyes and attempted to navigate a familiar space &amp;ndash; my guess is that people don&amp;rsquo;t imagine the table to be avoided 2 feet ahead of them, rather they have some spatial sense that doesn&amp;rsquo;t run through visual imagery.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Do you want me to listen to your ramblings, or do you want to solve the problem?&amp;rdquo;
30 minutes later, we turned to solving the problem.
&amp;ldquo;You must stop self-pitying.&amp;rdquo;
After the call, I gave myself evidence that I was the kind of person who was on the path to achieving my goals. I started wearing nice clothes, made bold professional asks, and tried to be lively at social events.</description>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/hours-have-different-value/</guid>
      <description>When you purchase an hour of time, it is not immediately obvious how much value you get, because (1) different hours have different value, and (2) it is not always clear which hour you are purchasing.
Different hours have different value Ways in which an hour can be more valuable to you include:
Time of day: morning, evening. Social context: with friends, with family, with strangers, alone. Location: at home, at work, at an art studio, on a beach, in a hospital.</description>

      <title>Ignoring the future when valuing time</title>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/ignoring-the-future/</guid>
      <description>Let’s suppose that all hours are equivalently valuable, and that you can easily earn more money by working more hours. There is still one more problem with valuing your time at your current average wage: not appropriately accounting for future benefits and costs.
Consider the following model of career progression:
In year \(0\), you are paid \($X\) (in nominal terms). In year \(1\), you are paid \($(X + W)\), or \($(X + W) \times R^{-1}\) in real terms.</description>

      <guid>https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/mistakes-valuing-time/</guid>
      <description>People who make somewhat explicit time-money trade-offs often use something like their average wage as a proxy for the &amp;ldquo;value of time&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the price at which they are indifferent between spending money to save an hour and spending an hour to save money.
This is a reasonable start, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s mistaken, for at least 2 important reasons:
The value of a purchased hour depends on more than just wage level.</description>

      <description>I think that valuing time at your average wage is mistaken, for at least 3 reasons:
The value of a purchased hour depends on more than just wage level. [&amp;hellip;] In most instances, the more leisure time you have, the less you value an additional hour of it. [&amp;hellip;] Separate from how much work and leisure time you have when deciding to buy an hour, particular hours have characteristics &amp;ndash; energy level, time of day, location, etc.</description>

Seeing through clouds Masha Gessen once wrote a series of articles for Slate grappling with her BRCA mutation. In the third article, she meets with my old boss David Laibson, hoping that he might be able to help think through the problem of whether to get an Oophorectomy, a Mastectomy, both, or neither.</description>

      <title>The cost of an O-1 visa</title>

      <description>Not legal advice.
I estimate that the O-1 visa process:
Cost me around $37k in resources and time working towards the visa (&amp;ldquo;accounting terms&amp;rdquo;), or $77k in resources, time working towards the visa, and time not working as a result of waiting for the visa (&amp;ldquo;economic terms&amp;rdquo;). Would have taken ~8 months excluding unrelated delays. Links to code for these estimates here and here.
The main cost estimate &amp;ndash; accounting cost &amp;ndash; consists of my time (~$12k), my PA&amp;rsquo;s time (~$7k), lawyer fees ($11k), administrative costs ($3k), and necessary organization expenses (~$4k).</description>

      <description>There is a near-consensus that diet is more important than exercise, at least for aesthetics.
I think this idea suffers from a similar problem as that suffered by &amp;lsquo;calories in calories out&amp;rsquo;: although it might be true in some idealized sense, &amp;ldquo;calories out are endogenous to what is eaten&amp;rdquo;.
Here, diet-in-reality is largely determined by &amp;rsquo;the kind of person you believe yourself to be.&amp;rsquo; Exercising more makes it easier to see yourself as the kind of person who takes diet seriously, and therefore improves diet.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve gotten past novitiate weightlifting aches, enduring 4+ sessions weekly. How should you now split exercises across days?
My answer is: use the posterior-anterior split. One day for the muscles used in a deadlift (back, hamstrings, glutes) plus biceps, one day for more-or-less everything else (chest, front- and side-delts, triceps, quads, hip flexors).
Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
The goal We want to train muscle groups as intensively as possible, as frequently as possible, whilst not training the same muscle group within fewer than 48 hours.</description>

Passion Fruit - agua de maracuya This &amp;ldquo;Passion Fruit&amp;rdquo; is a smoothie place in La Condesa (CDMX) that sells, among other treats, passion fruit juice by the bucket. My favorite passion fruit product of all time! I love that it isn&amp;rsquo;t too sweetened, and that the seeds have separated from the juice. The only problem is the large blocks of ice that they put in the buckets.</description>

      <title>Some intuitions about fellowship programs</title>

      <description>Epistemic status: not sure how reliable my intuition is, but I do have more experience with these programs than most.
TL;DR Making sure &amp;gt;30 participants have regular opportunities to spontaneously gather, active programming, basic food and medical amenities, and common knowledge about visit dates hugely increases the benefit of residential fellowship programs.
For transparency, I should note a stronger, less confident belief of mine that I will not defend here. My instinct is that all of the above factors are not merely beneficial but necessary in order for these programs to be worth their cost (assuming that their goals are indeed as I describe below).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about some mistakes people make when valuing their time, including not considering the differing value of different hours and treating time valuation as a static problem. I fear that these posts might communicate that I think people are merely miscounting the costs and benefits, and that relatively simple corrections would solve this. In reality, I think that the best way&amp;hellip;
Consider the following cases.

      <description>Suppose you agree with me that discussion of the &amp;ldquo;value of time&amp;rdquo; is ridden with conceptual confusion.
you seek a better way see conceptual confusion 1 notice that even if you can state how much better an hour of your time will be with friends vs alone, at cafe vs office, etc., you don&amp;rsquo;t know which hour this is occurring during toby has framework for this! Toby Ord presents a simple mathematical framework for understanding how reducing existential risk compares with other ways of influencing the longterm future.</description>

      <description>A dynamic model of time-money trade-offs People who make somewhat explicit time-money trade-offs often use something like their average wage as a proxy for the price at which they are indifferent between spending money to save an hour and spending an hour to save money.
This is a reasonable start, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s mistaken for at least 3 reasons:
Most people cannot earn an extra one hours of wages by working one hour more.</description>

      <description>When you purchase an hour of time, it is not immediately obvious how much value you get, because (1) different hours have different value, and (2) it is not always clear which hour you are purchasing.
Different hours have different value Ways in which an hour can be more valuable to you include:
Time of day: morning, evening. Social context: with friends, with family, with strangers, alone. Location: at home, at work, at an art studio, on a beach, in a hospital.</description>

      <description>The standard model of valuing time is ridden with conceptual confusion, and can easily lead to naive misvaluations of the true value of time.
Is there a better alternative?
One possibility is to borrow from Toby Ord&amp;rsquo;s framework for thinking about shaping the value of humanity&amp;rsquo;s longterm trajectory. Ord presents a framework</description>

(H/t Dr. Ted Miln.)

Hair loss is like a leaky bucket. 

You start with water, by default it drips out over time. (And, at a much slower rate, evaporates.) To keep water in the bucket, you can:

1. Tape the bucket (finasteride),
    - Double-tape the bucket (dutasteride),
2. Wait for rain (minoxidil), or
3. Add a bunch of water from a more stable bucket (hair transplant).

Taping the bucket without topping up the water ~stabilizes the situation, modulo some degree of evaporation. Later removing tape from the bucket reverses the stabilization. Adding water without taping the bucket ~returns you to an earlier point but doesn’t stop the process of water leaving the bath.

An imperfection of the analogy is that transplanted hairs don’t fall out, to a first approximation. You nonetheless will want to continue taking medications to stabilize pre-existing hair.

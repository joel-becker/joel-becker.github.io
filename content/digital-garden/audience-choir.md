- He very often seems to use triads. 
- - Surprising to me. I’m not sure what the binding constraint would be. Perhaps hearing people near you singing same note. But this plausibly accommodates >3 notes for larger audiences?
- - Maybe it's hard to transition >=2 sections of the choir whenever they're not moving in same direction, and >3 notes would cause this to need to happen more often. (But then why not use dyads.)
- Often he’s using sus2 or sus4 chords for triads other than the tonic chord, I guess because they enable him to move only 1 group of singers at a time.
- - E.g. C -> Fsus2 -> C -> Gsus4 only requires one group of singers to move E -> F -> E -> D.
- - Perhaps audiences find this easier?
- It’s curious that he only puts on the audience choir once per show or something. Plausibly it’s very fatiguing for audience attention?
- Audience choir rarely uses lyrics, and when he does use lyrics it's always repetitive chanting.
- At the end of fix you I think he has all audience members going up and down a tone from IV -> V -> IV. Maybe 3/3 groups moving is easier than 2/3? Probably only possible to do this when all notes moving in same direction.
- Tilting hands for semi-tones is a clever gesture.

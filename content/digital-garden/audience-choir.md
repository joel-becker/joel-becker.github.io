_Examples include [fix you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwC0Db7oerM), [white christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-R3M0VlQoQ), [let it be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs87FmbDC8A), [this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1MRXzZxsSc)_

1. He very often seems to use triads. 
    1. Surprising to me. I’m not sure what the binding constraint would be. Perhaps hearing people near you singing same note. But this plausibly accommodates >3 notes for larger audiences?
    2. Maybe it's hard to transition >=2 sections of the choir whenever they're not moving in same direction, and >3 notes would cause this to need to happen more often. (But then why not use dyads.)
2. Often he’s using sus2 or sus4 chords for triads other than the tonic chord, I guess because they enable him to move only 1 group of singers at a time.
    1. E.g. C -> Fsus2 -> C -> Gsus4 only requires one group of singers to move E -> F -> E -> D.
    2. Perhaps audiences find this easier?
3. It’s curious that he only puts on the audience choir once per show or something. Plausibly it’s very fatiguing for audience attention?
4. Audience choir rarely uses lyrics, and when he does use lyrics it's always repetitive chanting.
5. At the end of fix you I think he has all audience members going up and down a tone from IV -> V -> IV. Maybe 3/3 groups moving is easier than 2/3? Probably only possible to do this when all notes moving in same direction.
6. Tilting hands for semi-tones is a clever gesture.

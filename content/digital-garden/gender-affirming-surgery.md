My mid-2024 hair transplant has only recently started obviously coming into effect. (The growth process is advertised as not starting for 3 months; in my case nothing stark was beginning to happen until month 6ish.) I feel extremely happy with it.

Funnily enough, when I stare into my happiness, it feels really, really not others-facing. It's much more like:

1. I had a mental image of myself looking a certain way. ([Speaking loosely](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/aphantasia-ontology/).)
2. Previously, when I looked at myself in the mirror, what I saw felt discordant with that mental image.
3. Now, the mental image and what I see are in agreement. The world feels right, or something.

Perhaps not so dissimilar from e.g. trans women getting feminizing surgery? Another example is makeup use -- part of me used to think that women who claim to not wear makeup for men are BSing themselves, but now I kinda see it. 

(Of course, not all instances of cosmetic surgery or use of makeup are like this.)

Some things I think I know about finance:

1. I used to be in an EMHy crowd (economists), now find myself in an unusually anti-EMH crowd (AI/Bay Area). 
    1. It does feel pretty striking to have had a view that implied I could beat the S&P, bet on that view, and in fact (slightly) out-perform the S&P.
    2. On the other hand, it's hard to argue with deeply liquid markets filled with smart, highly-incentivized people. An example borrowed from [AGI and the EMH](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/agi-and-the-emh-markets-are-not-expecting-aligned-or): when the first hydrogen bomb tests were announced publicly, the stock prices of lithium producers spiked 461%, while prices of other radioactive metal producers remained flat, despite no public information being released that lithium was used in the tests.
    3. I currently roughly believe the [Grossman-Stiglitz version of the EMH](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/delivery.cfm/nber_R0121.pdf?abstractid=228054), in which markets have as much inefficiency as is required to compensate people for the costs of information acquisition. ("An equilibrium degree of disequilibrium.")
    4. I find myself more confidently disagreeing with the vibe in the Bay on the importance of financial sophistication. People take on a remarkably degree of idiosyncratic risk/have portfolios that I suspect can easily be dominated. (Seriously, some of the smartest people I know are >50% in a single AI bet.)
2. The low-info/neutral baseline strategy that's hard to beat is buying the market. But also... people who espouse this belief often seem to end up almost entirely concentrated in US equities.
3. Probably the [moral parliament](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf) approach to finance (assign shares to your beliefs, say 20%/10%/70%, then bet strongly on beliefs within those shares) can be dominated on risk-return by some other portfolio... but also fancy finance people can't seem to tell me how to go about this, and my portfolio construction code is extremely sensitive to minor changes in inputs.
4. Keeping <=5% in single assets seems like a reasonable heuristic. Except: most sophisticated people are violating this constantly (by failing to think of their future net wages as an asset), and QQQ is currently 9% Apple, 8% Microsoft, 7% Nvidia, 6% Amazon?

All considered, I haven't found a better process than

> moral paliament approach to finance; get weights by repeatedly asking yourself "is this stronger/weaker than what your beliefs imply?" until beliefs and parliament weights equilibrate.

I hope to give a more complete account of my portfolio at some point, but for now I'll say it's aiming for:

- ~20% stuff that's hard to move (e.g. minimum cash in bank, loans)
- ~50% something like '[global market portfolio](https://joel-becker.com/digital-garden/2025-gmp/)'
    - ~11% corporate bonds
    - ~31% government bonds
    - ~4% real estate
    - ~50% equity
    - ~4% commodities
- ~30% inside-view bets
    - ~30% AI-relevant hardware
    - ~10% between China, cloud, robotics, energy, raw materials
    - ~10% AI users (e.g. Google/Microsoft)
    - ~5% ETFs (semiconductors, energy, etc.)
    - ~-10% long-term bonds, ~+20% broad mostly UK/US equity (very unconcentrated; I'm not literally short bonds, just want to downweight vs. global market portfolio)
    - ~25% following investment advice from other groups I'm excited about
    - ~10% long-dated OTM call options

Here are some date ideas I'm excited about:

1. Karaoke/[Martuni's](https://martunis.restaurants-world.com/).
2. Jamming/singalong... on the beach?
3. Tasting! Coffee/chocolate/tea/wine/etc., ideally cocktails but a bit rough in SF.
4. Sit on a meditation pillow, listen to + comment on music that's personally meaningful.
5. Trampolining/trapeze class/novel exercise thing.
6. Picnic following a short hike.
7. Rooftop spa, sauna (maybe not first date?).
8. Quirky lecture/workshop.
9. Maybe my top choice: an evening loosely themed around your favourite book.

If you'd be excited to join me for one of these (or have a better suggestion), email [joelhbkr@gmail.com](mailto:joelhbkr@gmail.com) :)

For as long as I've been intentional about personal finances, I've been using [this 2014 blog post](https://www.gestaltu.com/2014/08/global-passive-benchmark-etf-factor-tilt.html/) to think about the global market portfolio. Time for a refresh. 

Turns out there are weigh more resources available on this than the last time I checked in. ([1](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/assets/pdf/global/pc/2024/global-market-portfolio-2024.pdf), [2](https://www.robeco.com/files/docm/docu-2024-robeco-5-year-expected-returns-atlas-lifted-us.pdf), [3](https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/sizing-up-the-global-market/05073690405).) The breakdown looks roughly like:

- ~45% global equities
- ~45% global bonds
    - ~21% government bonds
    - ~9% corporate bonds
    - ~5% securitized debt
    - ~10% emerging market debt/other
- ~4% real estate
- ~3% commodities (apparently 88% gold!)
- ~5% private credit

Public markets-only version gets you to more like ~50% equities, ~42% bonds, ~4% real estate, ~4% commodities.

### TL;DR

I went to Dr. Ted Miln, whom I recommend!

### The process

1. I can’t quite remember where I found the longlist from — I think reddit was most helpful because it seemed to have the least warped incentives?
2. I ranked options by a weighted sum of (1) strength of recommendation in longlist and (2) whether they offered both FUT in addition to FUE procedure. 
    - Offering FUT is surprisingly rare, and I think probably makes sense for a greater proportion of people than take this option in practice. (Informative video.) Even if it didn’t make sense for me (it likely did), I suspected that I should have more confidence going with some procedure X if the recommending surgeon is able to perform procedures X and Y vs. if the recommending surgeon only has a single procedure to shoe-horn me into. (Although note that in the end I had a dual FUT + FUE procedure from someone who specializes in dual FUT + FUE procedures…)
3. **I then took my preferred 3 from UK (relatively more expensive + less mill-like) and 2 from Turkey (relatively cheaper + more mill-like) and collected all before-and-after pictures wherein (1) you could see new hairline clearly or (2) the before was similar to my own case (lots of diffuse thinning but little recession). I tried to anonymize, put these in a google doc, shuffled, and asked people (in particular, my wonderful mum) to rate the quality of the procedures.**
    - This was great! It was very clear that Turkey clinics (and 1 of the UK clinics) were worse (sharper, denser, more aggressive, less natural hairlines) and revealed to me that the most expensive UK option was not obviously the best.
4. I had consultations with the two UK-based surgeons. Dr. Reddy struck me as indeed very expert, but also rushed and uninterested in thinking through competing considerations with me. Dr. Miln was like “we could do strategy A that is more typical, or strategy B that looks better in short term, or strategy C that provides more insurance in long-term, and here are the costs/benefits of these strategies.”

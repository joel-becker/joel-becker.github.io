# CLAUDE.md

## Git
- Only commit files you explicitly changed. There are other dirty files in the repo (public/, .DS_Store, etc.) that should not be included.

## Site structure
- Hugo site. `index.html` is the homepage.
- Research papers have inline press/talks/podcasts in `pdf-link` divs.

## Style conventions for research paper listings
- Coverage: `coverage in X, Y, Z`
- Talks: `talks at X, Y, Z`
- Podcasts: `podcast appearances on X, Y, Z`
- No colons — use lowercase descriptive phrases.
- Multiple articles from the same outlet: `Outlet (1, 2)` where each number is a separate link.
